## üöÄ What Can It Do?

* **Add, Edit, and Delete Tasks:** The core of any good to-do app. Quickly add new tasks, edit them if things change, and delete them once they're done.
* **Organize with Categories:** Group your tasks into helpful categories like "Work," "Personal," "Shopping," and "Health" to keep things tidy.
* **Set Priorities:** Mark tasks as "High," "Medium," or "Low" priority to know exactly what to focus on next.
* **Assign Due Dates:** Stay ahead of deadlines by adding a due date to any task.
* **See Your Progress at a Glance:** A sleek dashboard shows you your total tasks, how many you've completed, and your overall completion rate to keep you motivated.
* **Filter Your View:** Instantly filter your list to see only "Active" or "Completed" tasks, or view tasks from a specific category.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is a showcase of what can be accomplished with the fundamentals of web development.

* **HTML5:** The sturdy skeleton of the app.
* **CSS3:** For all the styling, from the beautiful gradient background to the responsive layout that works on any screen size.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** The brain of the operation! It handles everything from adding tasks and saving them to your browser's local storage to updating the stats on the dashboard.

## üåü What's Next?

I have a few ideas for making this app even better in the future:

* Add a backend to store tasks in a real database.
* Introduce user accounts so people can sign in and access their tasks from anywhere.
* Allow users to sort tasks by due date or priority.
* Implement a dark mode toggle for those late-night work sessions.
